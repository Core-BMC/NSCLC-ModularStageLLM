    "# Modular Agent-Based TNM Staging System for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to using the Modular Agent-Based TNM Staging System for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). This system implements both **AJCC 8th and 9th edition** TNM staging criteria using a modular agent architecture with Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Separate specialized agents for T, N, M, and Stage classification\n",
    "- **Histology Classification**: WHO-based histology classification system\n",
    "- **AJCC Edition Support**: Supports both AJCC 8th and 9th edition staging criteria (selectable)\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed justifications and confidence scores for each classification\n",
    "- **Reproducible Workflow**: State-based workflow using LangGraph for reliable execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a sequential workflow:\n",
    "1. **Histology Classification** → Identifies tumor histology type\n",
    "2. **T Classification** → Determines tumor size and local extent\n",
    "3. **N Classification** → Assesses lymph node involvement (with N2a/N2b subcategories in 9th edition)\n",
    "4. **M Classification** → Evaluates distant metastasis (with M1c1/M1c2 subcategories in 9th edition)\n",
    "5. **Stage Classification** → Combines T/N/M to determine overall stage\n",
    "\n",
    "### AJCC Edition Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**AJCC 8th Edition**:\n",
    "- Standard N classification (N0, N1, N2, N3)\n",
    "- Standard M classification (M0, M1a, M1b, M1c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**AJCC 9th Edition**:\n",
    "- **Enhanced N Classification**: Introduces N2a (single mediastinal station) and N2b (multiple mediastinal stations) subcategories\n",
    "- **Enhanced M Classification**: M1c subdivided into M1c1 (single organ system) and M1c2 (multiple organ systems)\n",
    "- Updated stage grouping rules\n",

    "#### Issue 2: Missing Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: `FileNotFoundError` for config or input files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Ensure the selected edition's configuration files exist:\n",
    "  - For 8th edition: `config/ajcc8th/tnm_config.yaml` and `config/ajcc8th/tnm_classification.json`\n",
    "  - For 9th edition: `config/ajcc9th/tnm_config.yaml` and `config/ajcc9th/tnm_classification.json`\n",
    "- Check that input Excel file path in config is correct (default: `input/evaluation_2_samples.xlsx`)\n",

    "- Ensure `AJCC_EDITION` variable is set correctly ('8th' or '9th')\n",
    "- Verify the project directory structure matches the expected layout\n",

    "#### Issue 3: LLM API Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: API timeout or rate limit errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Check API key validity\n",
    "- Verify endpoint URL is correct\n",
    "- Check rate limits and quotas\n",
    "- Consider adding retry logic (already implemented in workflow)\n",

    "#### Issue 5: Missing Medical Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: Low confidence classifications or \"Insufficient Data\" errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Ensure at least one relevant medical report is provided\n",
    "- For T classification: Pathology or Chest CT is essential\n",
    "- For N classification: EBUS or PET is recommended\n",
    "- For M classification: Brain MR, PET, or Bone Scan is recommended\n",

    "\n",
    "The system provides comprehensive logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Logs are written to:\n",
    "# - Console (INFO level)\n",
    "# - File: output/tnm_classification.log (DEBUG level)\n",
    "\n",
    "# To increase verbosity:\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.getLogger('tnm_workflow').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Processing Time**: Each case takes approximately 30-60 seconds depending on:\n",
    "  - Number of medical reports\n",
    "  - LLM response time\n",
    "  - Network latency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, process cases sequentially to avoid API rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: The workflow includes retry logic and error recovery mechanisms\n"
